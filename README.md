## CI Checks

CI checks will occur for every merge request, and they must pass as a
prerequisite for merging the MR!

- type-checking via typescript
- linting via eslint
- format-checking via prettier

You should be using a text editor like VS Code, which has a Language Support
Server for typescript, which will cause type-errors to immediately appear in
your editor. You should also install an eslint plugin for your editor, which
will cause linting errors to appear immediately in your editor. You should also
configure your editor to format files with prettier when you save.

You may also use the formatting script if you would not like to use prettier in
your editor; simply run `npm run fmt` to format everything!
