## **Lesson Materials**

Any large development project requires automated testing to ensure that nothing is broken as the application is maintained and as features are added. The testing also ensures that the program works to specifications. Manual testing with Postman or other tools is time consuming and error prone. This lesson gives practice in developing an API and shows how to do automated Express testing.

## **Assignments**

**Coding Assignment**

You fork and clone **[this repository](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/chaitest)**. Be sure that when you clone the repository the active directory is not inside node-express-course or any other git repository. The instructions for this lesson are in the README.md for the repository, as viewed in github, and they include directions on how to submit your work.

You are instructed to complete the tests, which are the files tests/tests.js and tests/puppeteer.js. Now, there are some places in these test files where the current code for the test just says done(), or, for the puppeteer tests, where the test function is empty. These are the places that you have to add code to complete the test. However ... this is not too easy, actually, so in case you get stuck, I have a sample answer repository that you can look at **[here.](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/chaitest-ans)**

**Mindset Assignment**
