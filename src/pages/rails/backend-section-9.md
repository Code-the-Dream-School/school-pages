# # Back End Lesson 4.2: Testing with RSpec

Rails testing with RSpec is an important skill. In some development shops, the RSpec tests are written first, before the functional code, so that the code is immediately shown to do what it is supposed to do. In this lesson, you will learn how to create two kinds of RSpec tests: model tests and request tests.

## Curriculum for Lesson 4.2

**4.2.1 [Rails Testing With RSpec](https://learn.codethedream.org/rails-basic-skills-rspec/)**

## Assignments

There is no new git repository for this lesson. You will continue working on the git repository and Rails application from Lesson 4.1\. You should use a new branch, called rspec. Be sure the validations branch is active when you create the rspec branch, so that the new branch builds on top of the old one.
