# # Back End Lesson 5.1: REST APIs in Rails

Welcome to Ruby on Rails Backend Class Lesson 5.1\. In this unit you will learn:

- How to develop a JSON API using Rails
- How to enable your API application for Swagger API testing and documentation
- How to call your API from a front end application using Ajax

## Curriculum

This is your curriculum for Lesson 5.1:  
\***\*5.1.1 [REST Introduction and Authentication](https://learn.codethedream.org/rest-introduction-and-authentication/)**
**5.1.2 [More REST for CRUD Operations](https://learn.codethedream.org/more-rest-apis/)**
**5.1.3 [Adding Rspec and Swagger](https://learn.codethedream.org/documenting-rest-apis-with-swagger/)**

## Assignments

The git repository with the starter Rails application for this lesson is **[here.](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/R6-rest-rails)** This is a long and somewhat difficult assignment. You will create three branches of this repository for the three parts of this lesson, a rest-authentication branch for your initial REST API on authentication work, a more-rest branch for adding CRUD operations, and, adding to that work, a swagger branch to add Swagger. You should do a pull request for each of the branches.
