# Back End Lesson 4.3: Rails Comprehensive Assignment

For this assignment, we will review many of the key Rails skills. You will create a model for orders. The customer model from the previous assignment will have a one-to-many association with the orders model. You will create a controller for orders, and routes to the controller methods. You will create views for order objects. You will also create RSpec tests.

There is no new assignment git repository. You will continue working on the same git repository and Rails application as you used for lessons 4.1 and 4.2, but you will use a new branch. This is described in the curriculum.
