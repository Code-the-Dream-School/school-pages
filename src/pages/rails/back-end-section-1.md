# Back End Lesson 1.1: SQL Basics

Welcome to Lesson 1 of the Ruby on Rails Backend Class. In this unit, we will learn:

- What are relational databases
- What are CRUD operations
- The basics of the SELECT statement for querying a database
- Filtering result sets with a WHERE clause
- Modifying data using INSERT INTO, UPDATE, and DELETE statements
- Some of the basics of SQL reporting, including ordering, paging, and limiting results

## Back End Lesson 1.1 Goals

- Understand how applications use databases
- Prepare for the next lesson when more complicated querying is discussed

## Curriculum

This is your curriculum for Back End 1 Lesson 1.  
**1.1.1 [SQL Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/sql-basics)** **(172 min)**  
**1.1.2 [Modifying Data with SQL](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/modifying-data-with-sql) (80 min)**  
**1.1.3 [Reporting with SQL](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/reporting-with-sql)** **(167 min- not as much of a priority)**

The reporting lesson is very long, and it is not critical that you complete it. Please complete the first lesson on ordering, limiting, and paging, and review the other lessons as time permits.

## Assignments

Your assignment for Lesson 1.1 can be found[ ](https://classroom.github.com/a/TEnB9osU)[**here**](https://github.com/Code-the-Dream-School/Backend-sqlintro).

In addition to this assignment, please set up your machine for Ruby and Rails development. It is quite easy to set up Linux and Mac machines for Ruby and Rails development, but it is harder on Windows. Instructions for all three platforms are given [**here**](https://learn.codethedream.org/configuring-your-machine-for-ruby-and-rails-version-6-development-a/). Please follow these instructions.

Your mindset curriculum will not begin until next week. We want you to focus on setting up your machine and getting comfortable with all the class tools this week.
