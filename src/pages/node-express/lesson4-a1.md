# Node/Express Lesson 4 Coding Assignment

For this lesson, you continue to work in the `node-express-course/02-express-tutorial` directory. As usual, you should use git to switch to a new branch, the `week4` branch _from_ the `week3` branch, before you start your work. However, there is a potential hitch. Suppose your `week3` branch has not been approved by your reviewer? You are going to continue to work on `app.js`, so your new changes might conflict with any changes that the reviewer requests. There are various ways to solve this problem, having to do with resolution of merge conflicts. One is as follows:

- Add and commit the changes you have made so far to the `week4` branch.
- Checkout `week3`.
- Make the changes requested by your reviewer, and add, commit, and push them. This adds them to your PR.
- Checkout `week4`.
- Do: `git merge week3 -m "merge of changes to previous week lesson"`. This brings in all the changes from `week3` into your `week4` branch.

At this point, you may get a merge conflict. This happens if there are changes to the same lines in the files in both the `week3` branch that you're trying to merge in and the `week4` branch that you're currently in. Git doesn't know which versions of those lines you want to keep If you know how to resolve merge conflicts,  this is the best way to proceed. If you do not know how to resolve merge conflicts, you will  need to learn it sooner or later.  There is a good tutorial **[here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz5OuKzvadQ)** But, here is an alternate procedure:

- Add and commit your changes to the `week4` branch.
- Checkout `week3`, make the changes required, and add, commit, and push.
- Checkout `week4`
- Do: `git checkout week3 -- app.js >apptemp.js`. This takes the version of app.js from the `week3` branch and puts it in a file called `apptemp.js`.
- Copy the changes you need from `apptemp.js` to `app.js`, and then erase `apptemp.js`

Make the following changes to `app.js` and related files.  (Note that examples of code that perform these functions are available in the `final` directory.) First, create a _middleware function_ called `logger` in `app.js`. A middleware function is passed `req` and `res` as its first two parameters, just like an `app.get` call, but it is also passed a third parameter, `next`. The next() function must be called once middleware processing is completed, otherwise no response is sent back for the request. The middleware function you create should log the `method` and `url` properties from the `req` object, as well as the current time, before calling `next()`. Middleware functions are called in two ways. First, you can insert them into your route statements, as follows:

```js
app.get('/', logger, (req, res) => {
    ...
})
```

This means the `logger` middleware function will run before any `GET` request to the `/` path.
The second way to invoke middleware is via an `app.use()` statement:

```js
app.use(['/path1', '/path2'], logger)
```

In this case, the first argument is a path or an array of paths indicating the urls for which the middleware is called. This argument is optional. If you leave it out, it is called for _**all**_ urls. When using an `app.use()` statement, order is important! For example, if you put `app.use(express.json())` after your `app.post()` statement, the `app.post()` won't work as expected, because the body will not have been parsed into JSON yet. Call your logger using the first method, in one of your `app.get()` statements, and verify that it works. Then, take the logger call out of your `app.get()` statement, and call it via `app.use()`, for all paths, instead. Verify that it still works. 

Next, you need to implement some APIs for people. You have a require statement for `./data.js` that gets the value of products. Get the value for people, also from `./data.js` (add this in the same require statement). Then implement an `app.get` for `/api/v1/people`. Test it with your browser.  You are returning JSON, so you call res.json(...) to send the data back. You now need to implement an `app.post` for `/api/v1/people`. This is to add an entry to the people array. Post operations are sent from the browser with a "request body". You need to add middleware to parse this body into a Javascript object. The following statements do this parsing, returning the result as a hash in `req.body`.

```js
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }))
app.use(express.json())
```

The first of these parses url-encoded data, which is the format that is sent by an HTML form. This is not typically needed if you are only implementing a JSON API. The second statement parses a JSON body. You need these statements before your `app.post()` statement, so that the body is parsed before you do the rest of the processing. Now you implement the `app.post` statement for `/api/v1/people`. The statement should check `req.body` to see if there is a `req.body.name` property. If not, it should return JSON for an error, as follows:

```js
res.status(400).json({success: false, message: 'Please provide a name'})
```

This sets the HTTP result code to [400](https://http.dev/400), which means there was an error on the client side, and also returns an error message. But suppose there is a value in req.body.name. You want to add this entry to the people array, as follows:

```js
people.push({ id: people.length, name: req.body.name })
req.status(201).json({ success: true, name: req.body.name })
```

The HTTP status code [201](https://http.dev/201) means that an object was created on the server side. Of course, as there is no database, this data will be gone when you restart the server. 

Now is the time to test it out using Postman. Create a Postman GET request for `/api/v1/people` and verify that that works. Then create a Postman POST request for `/api/v1/people`. Choose the 'raw' form of the body, and select JSON from the pull-down. Put a JSON object with a name in the body, and verify that that works. Do the GET request again from Postman, to verify that the person is added to the array. Try the POST request with an invalid body as well. The instructor has provided a sample front end, and you can try this as well. Change the directory for your static serving from `./public` to `./methods-public`, and try out that frontend from your browser. 

The next step is refactoring. You do not want too much logic in the `app.js` file. Create directories called routes and controllers. Create a file called `routes/people.js`. It should start with the following statements:

```js
const express = require('express')
const router = express.Router()
```

You then need to add a `router.get()` statement for the `"/"` path. This should do the same thing as your `app.get("/api/v1/people")` statement. Similarly, you need a `router.post()` statement for `"/"`. Finally, at the bottom, you need `module.exports = router`. You now need to add a require statement in the `app.js` file, to import the `peopleRouter` code. Then you need the following `app.use()` statement, also in app.js:

```js
app.use('/api/v1/people', peopleRouter)
```

Be careful that this `app.use` statement comes _after_ the parsing of the body, or stuff won't work as expected. Then comment out your `app.get` and `app.post` statements for `/api/v1/people`. Test the result using Postman, fixing bugs as needed. The refactoring is not yet done. You need to create the file `controllers/people.js`. That should start with a require statement that gets the people array from `../data.js`. Then create functions `addPerson` and `getPeople`. These are each passed `req` and `res`. Copy the logic from your `router/people.js` file, for both the GET and the POST. Then export `{ addPerson, getPeople }`. Then require them in your `routes/people.js`, as follows:

```js
const { addPerson, getPeople } = require('../controllers/people.js')
```

Then change the `router.get` and `router.post` statements to call these functions, instead of doing the processing inline. Test again using Postman. You could also refactor the products routes, but it is not required for this assignment. Add a `router.get` statement to `routes/people.js`. This is to get a particular entry from the people array. You need an `id` parameter, so the path should have `/:id`. Then write code so that, if the array includes a people entry with a matching id, a JSON object with that entry is returned (return code [200](https://http.dev/200)). You can use `Array.find()`, but `req.params.id` will be a string, so you"ll have to convert it to an integer first. If the entry is not found, return an error [404](https://http.dev/404) with JSON that has an appropriate message. Test this with Postman. 

Then move the logic for the statement to `controllers/people.js`, and update the `module.exports` statement in that file, as well as the require statement in the `routes/people.js`, so that the route calls the controller function you create. Add a `router.put` statement to `routes/people.j`s to update the people entry if it is found, and to return an error if it isn't. The processing for this should be in the controller. Do a `router.delete` statement as well. Test these using Postman. For the delete, you might use `Array.filter()` to create the updated people array.

## Optional Additional Assignment

This optional assignment gives some idea of how authentication might work. You will use the `cookie-parser` npm package, so do an `npm install` for that package.  Cookies are set, typically by the back end, the browser then stores them and attaches them to  each subsequent request. This allows us to add some "state" to each HTTP request. That is, the browser and backend can 'remember' some information automatically across requests, like for example, which user is making these requests. Add to `app.js` a require statement for `cookie-parser`. Then, right after you parse the body of the request, add a statement to parse the cookies:

```js
app.use(cookieParser())
```

Now write a middleware function called `auth`. This checks for `req.cookies.name`. If that cookie is present, it sets` req.user` to the value, and calls `next`. If it is absent, it sets the res status to [401](https://http.dev/401) (which means unauthorized), and returns a message in a JSON object that says "unauthorized". It **_does not_** call `next()` in this case. (Typically middleware would throw an error at this point, instead of returning a result.) Now add an `app.post("/logon")`, which should require a name in the body. If it is present, it should do a `res.cookie("name", req.body.name)`, and send back a 201 result code plus a message that says hello to the user. If name is not present, it should return a 400 and an error message in JSON. Now add an a`pp.delete("/logoff")`. This should do a `res.clearCookie("name")`, and then it should return a 200, with a message in JSON that the user is logged off. Now add an `app.get("/test")`. The auth middleware should be invoked in this `app.get` statement. The get should just return a 200, plus a message in JSON that says welcome to the user, whose name is in `req.user`. Then test this with Postman. You should be able to logon, logoff, and test, and the test should do something different depending on whether or not you are logged in.

When you have completed your programming assignment, git add, git commit, and git push your branch, and create a pull request, so that you can include a link to your pull request in your homework submission.
