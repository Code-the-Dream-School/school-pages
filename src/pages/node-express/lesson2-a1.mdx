## **Practice with NPM and Async Patterns**

<ReviewLessonButton link="/node-express/lesson2-m1" />

For week 1, you created files in the `node-express-course/01-node-tutorial/answers` directory. For week 2, you'll continue to do your work in that same directory. However, before you do your work for this week, you must switch to a new git branch. While the week1 branch is active, use the command

```bash
git checkout -b week2
```

As you will be working on the `node-express-course` repository for some weeks, this is the way you separate your assignments for each week. The key topics in this section are:

- how to use `npm` and the `package.json` file to manage a Node project and its dependencies
- async patterns
- event emitters and handlers
- streams

The instructor does provide examples if you need them. Just like the previous lesson, you will work in the `answers` directory within the `01-node-tutorial` directory. Follow these steps:

1. Within your answers directory, create a file called `.gitignore`. It should have the following lines:

```
/node_modules
.DS_Store
```

<p class="ml-8">
  You do not want to store the contents of <code>node_modules</code> in Github,
  because they are already present on the web as public files, accessible by
  npm. As well, the <code>node_modules</code> folder can get very large, which
  would slow down our git operations if we include it. The{" "}
  <code>.DS_Store</code> file is sometimes created by the Mac operating system,
  and you don’t need that one in Github either.
</p>

2. Within your `answers` directory, run the command `npm init`. You can accept all the defaults, except you can enter your name when it prompts you for author. This creates a `package.json` file.

3. Enter the following command:

```bash
    npm install nodemon --save-dev
```

<p class="ml-8">
  As the instructor has described, <code>npm</code> gives you access to a large
  library of reusable code, available at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/).
  You have just installed one package, but you have also installed all its
  dependencies, and they are all stored in the <code>./node_modules</code>{" "}
  directory. You can see what you have installed by looking at package-lock.json
  (which is automatically generated and updated whenever you install, update, or
  remove packages). You will never need to manually modify the{" "}
  <code>package-lock.json</code> file, though you _can_ make changes to the{" "}
  <code>package.json</code> file. The package you've just installed,{" "}
  <code>nodemon</code>, is very useful for development, but you wouldn’t want to
  deploy it to the cloud, as it is not useful in production, so it is installed
  as a "dev dependency".
</p>

4. Edit the `package.json` file. This file manages your project, enabling others to contribute and also providing a means to deploy the project to the cloud. You can read a description of package.json [here](https://nodesource.com/blog/the-basics-of-package-json-in-node-js-and-npm/). There is one other entry that is often useful, called engines. This can be used to specify which version of node your package requires. But for now, you are just going to set up the scripts stanza. Edit it to look like the following:

```json
      "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
        "dev": "nodemon prompter.js",
        "start": "node prompter.js"
      },
```

<p class="ml-8">
  The scripts give npm commands you can run as you develop. In this case, the
  command, <code>npm run dev</code> will run the code in the{" "}
  <code>prompter.js</code> file, using the <code>nodemon</code> library.{" "}
  <code>nodemon</code> will basically just run the file with <code>node</code>,
  and if you make any changes to the program, <code>nodemon</code> will
  automatically restart node for you so that it's running the updated code. This
  is useful to test continuously as you are changing your program. The command{" "}
  <code>npm run start</code> or just <code>npm start</code> runs the program
  under <code>node</code>, which is how it would run in production.
</p>

5. From within your terminal, while you are in the `answers` directory, run the command `npm run dev`. The prompter program starts, and you can access the page from [http://localhost:3000]() in your browser. Now edit `prompter.js` and add a comment. Nodemon restarts the program, because `prompter.js` has changed. As before, you use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> to end the program. Nodemon is only important for programs that keep running until you press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd>. It is not needed for programs that end by themselves. Now for some code:

<p class="ml-8">
  The instructor showed several patterns for JavaScript asynchronous
  programming. An asynchronous Javascript function returns a{" "}
  <a href="https://javascript.info/promise-basics">Promise</a>, or in some cases
  a “thenable” which acts like a Promise. You need to resolve the Promise in
  order to get the actual return value. To resolve a Promise inside an{" "}
  <code>async function</code>, you use the keyword, <code>await</code>. This
  should be used inside a <code>try/catch</code> block so that you can handle
  any errors, as follows:
</p>

```js
const myFunc = async () => {
    ...
    return result
}

const myFunc2 = async () => {
    try {
       result = await myFunc()
       ...
    } catch(err) {
        console.log("An error occurred: ", err)
    }
}
```

<p class="ml-8">
  Sometimes you need to call an async function from within another function that
  is not async. In this case, you can’t use <code>await</code> – it will give a
  syntax error. So you can either use <code>.then</code> or you can wrap the
  function call as follows:
</p>

```js
const myFunc3 = () => {  // not async, and in some contexts we better not make it async
   myFunc()
   .then((result) => {
      console.log("got the result.")
      ...
   })
   .catch((error)=> {
      console.log("An error occurred: ", error)
   })
}

const myFunc4 = () => {  // the other way to do it, via a wrapper:
    const myFunc5 = async () => {
        try {
               result = await myFunc() {
               console.log("got the result.")
               ...
            }
        } catch(error) => {
            console.log("An error occurred: ", error)
        }
    }
    myFunc5() // here's where we call the wrapper, but do NOT do this:
    // result = myFunc5()  This won't work because myFunc5 is asynchronous!
    // All you'd get back is a Promise, not the result.
}
```

<p class="ml-8">
  There’s one more trick with the <code>.then</code>. Suppose you need to make a
  string of calls to async functions. You can chain the <code>.then</code>{" "}
  statements as follows:
</p>

```js
const myFunc6 = () => {
  myFunc() // an async function, so it returns a promise
    .then((result) => {
      console.log("got the first result");
      return myFunc(); // here we call it again, we return the promise myFunc returns
    })
    .then((result) => {
      console.log("got the second result");
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.log("An error occurred: ", err);
    });
};
```

<p class="ml-8">
  So, you can chain a collection of async calls with <code>.then</code>{" "}
  statements, followed by one <code>.catch</code> at the end.
</p>

Ok, that’s the summary. Be sure that you understand this. We will do a lot of asynchronous programming in Express.

---

Now for the programs to write for this assignment:

1.  Create a program named `writeWithPromisesAwait.js` inside the `01-node-tutorial/answers` folder. We are going to use the fs.promises package. `fs` is the built-in "File system" set of functions in [Node](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#promises-api). By adding `.promises` we're going to access the versions of those built-in functions that return a Promise as their result. You’d start with the following code:

```js
const { writeFile, readFile } = require("fs").promises;
```

<div class="ml-8">
  <p>
    Then create an <code>async function</code> called <code>writer</code> that
    takes 0 arguments, and that writes three lines to a file, by calling the{" "}
    <code>writeFile</code> function with <code>await</code>. The Promise-version
    of <code>writeFile</code> takes the same arguments as the one you used in
    last week's exercise <code>10-fs-sync</code> but will return a Promise
    instead of a result directly.{" "}
    <strong>
      Put the await statements inside a <code>try/catch</code> block!
    </strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Create another async function called <code>reader</code> that reads the file
    with <code>await readFile</code> and logs the return value to the screen.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now we want to call the two functions in order, first the writer, and the
    reader. But, be careful! These are asynchronous functions, so if you just
    call them, you don’t know what order they’ll occur in. And you can’t use
    await in your mainline code. So, you write a third async function called{" "}
    <code>readWrite</code>. In that function, you call await reader and await
    writer. Finally, write a line at the bottom of the file that calls the
    `readWrite` function. Test your code by running The file that your code is
    creating should not be sent to Github, so you should add its filename as
    another line to your <code>.gitignore.</code>
  </p>
</div>

2.  Write another program called `writeWithPromisesThen.js` also in the `01-node-tutorial/answers` folder. You start it the same way, but this time, you use the `.then` style of asynchronous programming. You don’t need to create any functions. Instead, you just use cascading .then statements in your mainline, like this:

```js
 writeFile(...) // write line 1
 .then(() => {
    return writeFile(...)  // write line 2.
    // Return the promise so you can chain the .then statements
 })
 .then // write the third line, and follow that with two more .then blocks,
 // one to call readFile to read it back out, and one to log the data to the screen.
 ...
 .catch((error) => {
     console.log("An error occurred: ", error)
 })
```

<p class="ml-8">
  Test your code by running <code>node writeWithPromisesThen.js</code>. You may
  want to sprinkle console.log statements in your code so that you understand
  the order of execution.
</p>

3.  We want to understand event emitters. First, modify `prompter.js`, to add the following lines above the listen statement:

```js
server.on("request", (req) => {
  console.log("event received: ", req.method, req.url);
});
```

<p class="ml-8">
  Then test this (<code>npm run dev</code>) and try with your browser to see the
  events the server is emitting.
</p>

4.  Write a program named `customEmitter.js` in the `01-node-tutorial/answers` folder. In it, create one or several emitters. Then use the emitter `.on` function to handle the events you will emit, logging the parameters to the screen. Then use the emitter `.emit` function to emit several events, with one or several parameters, and make sure that the events are logged by your event handlers. This is your chance to be creative! You could have an event handler that emits a different event to be picked up by a different handler, for example. Here’s a couple tricks to try. You can trigger events with a timer, as follows:

```js
const EventEmitter = require("events");

const emitter = new EventEmitter();

setInterval(() => {
  emitter.emit("timer", "hi there");
}, 2000);

emitter.on("timer", (msg) => console.log(msg));
```

<p class="ml-8">Or, you could make an async function that waits on an event:</p>

```js
const EventEmitter = require("events");

const emitter = new EventEmitter();

const waitForEvent = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    emitter.on("happens", (msg) => resolve(msg));
  });
};

const doWait = async () => {
  const msg = await waitForEvent();
  console.log("We got an event! Here it is: ", msg);
};

doWait();
emitter.emit("happens", "Hello World!");
```

<p class="ml-8">
  Don't worry if that last one looks a bit complicated. That's expected as we
  haven’t talked about creating promises yet.)
</p>

5. Change back to the `01-node-tutorial` directory and run `15-create-big-file.js`. This creates a big file in the content directory. You’ll note that the instructor has a `.gitignore` that includes the file name that's created by that code so that it isn’t stored in Github. You should also add the file (or files) that you wrote to in the previous steps to your `.gitignore` file.
6. Now, change back to the `answers` directory, and write a program called `16-streams.js`. It should create a read stream for the big file (.`./content/big.txt`) with encoding of `"utf8"` and a `highWaterMark` of `200`. The `highWaterMark` is the maximum amount of bytes that node will read with each chunk of the stream. The program should initialize a counter to 0. Then it should handle the `“data”` event for the stream by incrementing the counter and logging the event result to the screen. Then it should handle the `“end”` event by reporting the number of chunks received. Finally, it should handle the stream `“error”` event by logging the error to the console. Test the program for several values of highWaterMark. You can look at `01-node-tutorial/16-streams.js` file to help you as needed.
7. Have a look at `17-http-stream.js`. You don’t need to write a program, but observe how the chunks that are read from the stream are piped to the `res` object that is returned from the http request. Try to understand this program. Usually, if you are sending back voluminous data in response to an HTTP request, you want to break it up into chunks.

That's all for this week, great job! Note, that while the `01-node-tutorial` folder has files for `13-event-emitter.js` and `14-request-event.js`, we've substituted those with the event emitter work in this week's assignment and the `prompter.js` work in the previous assignment. You can still feel free to follow along with the video and complete those files if you'd like.

When you have completed your programming assignment, do a `git add` for all your changes to the branch,
commit the changes, and push the changes to your repository. Then create a pull request. A link
to the pull request is to be included in your homework submisson.
