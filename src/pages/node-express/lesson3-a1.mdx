# Node/Express Lesson 3 Coding Assignment

<ReviewLessonButton link="/node-express/lesson3-m1" />

The basic elements of an Express.js program are as follows:

- The `require` statement to import the `express` module
- Creation of the app as returned from calling `express()`
- `app.use` statements for the middleware. You'll eventually use many kinds of middleware, but for now the only middleware we are using is `express.static()`.
- `app.get` and `app.post` statements for the routes you will handle. Eventually these will be refactored into router modules, but for now you can put them inline.
- An `app.all` statement after these to handle page not found conditions.
- An `app.listen` statement to tell the server to listen for requests on a particular port.

You continue working in the node-express-course repository, but for this week, you switch to the 02-express-tutorial directory. This week introduces the Express npm package, which makes web development much quicker than using Node alone. There is no need to use an answers folder. You just put your work in the 02-express-tutorial folder. Complete the following steps:

1. While the `week2` branch is active, create a `week3` branch, for this week's work (`git checkout -b week3`).
2. While you are in the `02-express-tutorial` folder, run `npm install`. The instructor has provided a `package.json` and a `.gitignore`. The `package.json` already has the express package defined in it, so running the command `npm install` will do the installation of that package, as needed for this week's work.
3. Create a folder named `public` within `02-express-tutorial`. Create an HTML file within it called `index.html`. It's not critical what you put in the HTML file – just something simple.
4. Edit `app.js` to add all the elements of an Express application as listed above, in the right order. You won't have any `app.get` or `app.post` statements yet. You should have the statement `app.use(express.static("./public"))` so that your HTML file will load. Use port 3000 in the listen statement.
5. Start the server, with `npm start`. Then use your browser to load [http://localhost:3000](). You should see the HTML page you created.
6. Try the URL [http://localhost:3000/not-there](). You should see that your `app.all` for page not found returns a 404 error.
7. For the next part, you will implement APIs that return JSON. Because you are using the browser to display the JSON, you may want to add a JSON formatter plugin into your browser ([here's one for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jsonvue/chklaanhfefbnpoihckbnefhakgolnmc), for example), so that it's easier to view. Add an `app.get` statement to `app.js`. It should be _after_ the Express static middleware, but _before_ the "not found" handler. It should be for the URL `/api/v1/test`. It should return JSON using the following code:

```js
res.json({ message: "It worked!" });
```

<p class="ml-8">Try that URL from your browser, and verify that it works.</p>

8. Next, we want to return some data. We haven't learned how to access a database from Express yet, so the instructor has provided data to use. It is in `data.js`, so have a look at that file. Then add the following require statement to the top of the program:

```js
const { products } = require("./data");
```

<p class="ml-8">
  The value of the products variable is an array of objects from{" "}
  <code>data.js</code>, which are various items of furniture. We now want to
  return this array. So add an <code>app.get</code> statement for the url{" "}
  <code>/api/v1/products</code>. Write some code to return JSON for the products
  array. Test the url with your browser.
</p>

9. Next, you need to provide a way to retrieve a particular product by ID. This is done by having an `app.get` statement for the url `/api/v1/products/:productID`. The colon in this url means that `:productID` is a _parameter_. So, when your server receives the GET request for a URL like `/api/v1/products/7`, `req.params` will have the hash `{ productID: 7 }`. Try this out by creating the `app.get` statement and doing a `res.json(req.params)` to return the path parameter in the HTTP response itself.
10. Of course, the API should actually return, in JSON form, the product that has an ID of 7. So you need to find that product in the array. For that, you use the `.find` [function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find) of the array:

```js
const idToFind = parseInt(req.productID); // parseInt will convert a string to an integer
const product = products.find((p) => p.id === idToFind);
```

<p class="ml-8">
  Change the app.get statement so that it returns JSON for the product. Test it
  out.
</p>

11. The user may request a product that is not there, for example with a URL like `/api/v1/products/5000` or `/api/v1/products/nottthere`. So in that case, you should return a 404 status code and the JSON `{ message: "That product was not found."}`. Add this logic to the `app.get` statement, and test that it works.
12. The user may also want to do a simple search, instead of getting all the products. In this case, the url would contain a query string, like: `/api/v1/query?search=al&limit=5`.

    What this means, in this case, is that the user wants to see all products where the name starts with "al", but the user wants to see no more than 5 products. When the `app.get` for `/api/v1/query` path is called, `req.query` is a hash that may contain values for "search" or "limit" or both or neither, depending on what the user puts in the query string. Again, there are array methods you can use to find that list. They are `Array.filter()` and `Array.slice()`. Add a new `app.get` statement for `/api/v1/query`, and include logic to handle these query strings. Then test it out.

13. Add some more logic: you choose! For example, the user might want to send a regular expression instead of search for starting letters. Or the user may only want products that cost less than 20.00.
14. Optional additional item: Add a button to your `index.html`. Add JavaScript, either within a `<script>` tag in `index.html` or in a JavaScript file it references (which would also be in the public directory.) When you click the button, your JavaScript would issue a fetch call for `/api/v1/products`. Then you'd add the data you get back to a div in your HTML.

## Bonus Assignment

In the `node-express-course/week_3_alt_assignment` directory, a sample express application is provided.  This is to give you a chance to do something creative with Express!  Completion of the assignment is optional.The goals of the lesson are in the `README.md` in that folder, and the instructions are in `index.js`.  You should first run the sample. You can then follow the instructions to create your own simple game.  You'd give your file a name like `app.js` (also within the same directory, and you'd change the `package.json` so that the start command runs `app.js` instead of `index.js`. The example shows how HTML returned by the application can be made dynamic, through string interpolation.  We'll learn another way to return dynamic HTML later in the course. You should certainly run the sample application, as it explains important concepts.  Creation of your own game is optional, but recommended.
