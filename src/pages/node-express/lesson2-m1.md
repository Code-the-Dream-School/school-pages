# Node/Express Lesson 2: NPM and Async Patterns

This lesson covers how to use the node package manager npm to install additional modules from the npm library. It also covers event processing and async patterns in node. There are several introductory videos to watch. **[This link](https://medium.com/@mmoshikoo/event-loop-in-nodejs-visualized-235867255e81)** and **[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)** cover the event loop, and are referred to as external resources in the main video. **[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cFTFtuEQ-10)** covers try/catch/throw error handling in JavaScript, which is critical when writing asynchronous code. You continue watching **[this video](https://youtu.be/Oe421EPjeBE?t=6357)**. This week, you watch from 1:45:57 of the video to 3:40:46. As before, the video is broken up into chapters, so that you can review chapters as needed to complete the programming assignment. **Important:** At about 2:03 of the video, the instructor does some git operations. **Do not do these.** You do need to create the .gitignore file, but you definitely do not do a git init inside the answers directory. That would create a git repository nested within your existing repository, which is a mess. In general, in this and all future videos, igore any git operations the instructor performs. You already have the git repository you need.
