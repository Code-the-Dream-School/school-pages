# Node/Express Lesson 5

# Task Manager API Part 1

Watch the Build 4 Node/Express Projects video **[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rltfdjcXjmk&t=23313s)**. This lesson is on the first 1:28:45 of the video; lesson 6 will start with the section on validation. In this lesson and in several that follow, **you duplicate the work of the instructor**, testing as you go with Postman. Since you will be building and testing as you watch, read through the Coding Assignment section below **before** starting the video.
