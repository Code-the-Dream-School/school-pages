## **Introducing Node Programming**

A simple introduction to Node is available at **[this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uVwtVBpw7RQ)**. Just watch the first video in the series.

Be aware of this **[descriptive introduction to Node](https://medium.com/@frankstepanski/beginning-node-and-express-3482238c5c94)**, by our staff member Frank. There are a number of sections that are too technical for now, but you may want to refer to it in the future.

Watch the first 1:45:57 of **[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oe421EPjeBE)**. You may first want to review the coding assignment below. In your assignment, you create programs similar to those  
that the instructor demonstrates.
