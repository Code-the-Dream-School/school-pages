# Node/Express Lesson 14

# Using EJS in a Database Application

You have created a project with EJS that includes various views, user registration and logon,
and secure routes. What remains is to perform CRUD operations to the database. Once
you can do that, you can use EJS for a variety of projects. There are no new concepts in
this lesson. It is just practice of the techniques you have learned.
