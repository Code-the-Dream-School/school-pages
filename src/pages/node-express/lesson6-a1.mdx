# Node/Express Lesson 6 Coding Assignment

<ReviewLessonButton link="/node-express/lesson6-m1" />

Create a new git branch called `week6`. **This should be created when the `week5` branch is active, so that it adds to week 5's work.** If you've made any changes to the `week5` branch due to reviews on your PR, make sure to update your `week6` branch by following the instructions from [Lesson 4](/node-express/lesson4-a1#:~:text=There%20are%20various%20ways%20to%20solve%20this%20problem%2C%20having%20to%20do%20with%20resolution%20of%20merge%20conflicts.) Continue to work in the `node-express-course/03-task-manager/starter` directory. You
duplicate the work of the instructor in the video.

## Additional Assignment

Create a file in the starter directory called `QuizAnswers2.txt`. Put answers to the following questions in it.

1.  In this lesson, you created a middleware function called `asyncWrapper`. Why?
2.  Suppose that you want to make sure that both a status code and an error message are sent back to the user when they request the URL for a task that does not exist. Assume that you've created a `CustomAPIError` class and an error handler that references that class. Complete the code:

```js
const getTask = asyncWrapper(async (req, res, next) => {
  const { id: taskID } = req.params;
  const task = await Task.findOne({ _id: taskID });
  if (!task) {
    // your code here
  }
  res.status(200).json({ task });
});
```

As you will see in the lessons that follow, you do not have to always create the `asyncWrapper` middleware, because you can instead use an NPM package called `express-async-errors` that provides the same capability.
